# a function that takes two lists of numbers and returns the result of merging the lists. 
# The elements of the first list should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned list, 
# while the elements of the second list should become the elements at the odd indexes. For instance:

# merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) # => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]
# You may assume that both list arguments have the same number of elements.
